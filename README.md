# big-commerce-empty-cart-button
Add in a button on the checkout so the user can empty their cart, EG should the order not longer need to be placed.

Copy the contents of the empty-cart.js file to your script manager, update the line with "fetch" so that it points to the PHP backend script on your server.

Upload the empty-cart.php file to your server, ensure it is correctly linked in the js file. Update your store ID and API key in the PHP script.
