# BigCommerce Empty Cart Button

A small utility used to control or customise empty cart button behaviour on BigCommerce stores.

This was created as part of client work where default cart behaviour didn’t fit the required UX or commercial flow.

## Use case
- User wishes to delete their cart EG, In b2b context another buyer has already placed the order, or the items are no longer needed.

This is not a packaged library — just a simple, practical snippet that may be useful to others working on BigCommerce storefronts.

## Notes
Provided as-is. Intended for developers familiar with BigCommerce theme customisation.

## Installation

Upload the empty-cart.php file to your server. Update your store ID and API key in the PHP script.

Copy the contents of the empty-cart.js file to your script manager, update the line with "fetch" so that it points to the PHP backend script on your server.
